# Close milestones that are done

Automatically closes milestones that have more than one issue/pr and all issues/prs are marked closed.

### Usage

Basic (runs every 20 minutes):
```yaml
name: "Close finished milestones"
on:
  schedule:
  - cron: "*/20 * * * *"

jobs:
  milestone-closer:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
    - uses: instantish/milestone-closer@v1.1.0
      with:
        repo-token: ${{ secrets.GITHUB_TOKEN }}
```

Runs on issue and PR updates:
```yaml
name: "Close finished milestones"
on:
  issues:
    types: [opened, deleted, closed, reopened, milestoned, demilestoned]
  pull_request:
    types: [opened, closed, reopened]

jobs:
  milestone-closer:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
    - uses: instantish/milestone-closer@v1.1.0
      with:
        repo-token: ${{ secrets.GITHUB_TOKEN }}
```

Uses a different minimum number of issues:
```yaml
name: "Close finished milestones"
on:
  schedule:
  - cron: "*/20 * * * *"

jobs:
  milestone-closer:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
    - uses: instantish/milestone-closer@v1.1.0
      with:
        repo-token: ${{ secrets.GITHUB_TOKEN }}
        min-issues: 3
```
